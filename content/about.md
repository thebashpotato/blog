This blog will be focused on lower level application programming for Unix systems.
Focused languages are C, C++ and Rust. Focused projects will be writing
an X11 tiling window manager, an Original Nintendo Emulator,
and desktop applications using the new [Tauri framework](https://tauri.app/).
Other topics may include editors and how to configure them, such as Neovim and Emacs,
creating and maintaining my own Linux distribution, embedded development using
the [Yocto project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) and my opinions on University as pertaining to Mathematics and Computer Science,
its clear inabillity to innovate, cope/adapt to the internet, and whether or not my time spent there was largely a waste.
